# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-News-Headlines
In a developing country like India, the rise and fall of stock prices depends largely on the sentiments of the people. In this project, I have tried to predict the rise and fall of stock prices in accordance with the top 25 newspaper headlines from 2000-01-03 to 2016-07-01. The data has one column for label which has value 1 if our prediction is correct and 0 if our prediction is incorrect.
## Model
The model is divided into the train and test part with the older years' headlines being used for train part and the new headlines being used for test part.
